SpeedFixer lets you customise the speedbreaker mechanic:
 • above what speed it can be activated,
 • how long it can stay activated,
 • whether it can recharge passively,
 • above what speed it recharges passively,
 • how long it takes to recharge passively,
 • how drifting translates to recharging,
 • above what speed drifting can recharge,
 • above what slip-angle drifting can recharge,
 • how much it slows down in-game time,
 • how much it scales mass for collisions,
 • how much it scales gravity for downforce,
 • how much it boosts front-wheel friction,
 • what maximum steering angle it allows,
 • how much aerodynamic drag applies, and
 • how much steering drag applies.

The SECTIONS BELOW address these questions in detail:
 1) • What mods are (in)compatible with SpeedFixer?
 2) • How do I install SpeedFixer for my game?
 3) • How may I share or bundle SpeedFixer?






── ■ │ 1 - WHAT MODS ARE (IN)COMPATIBLE WITH SPEEDHATER? │ ■ ──────────────────────────────────────

All VLTED AND BINARY MODS should be fully compatible with all SpeedFixer configurations.

Almost all OTHER .ASI MODS should be fully compatible with all SpeedFixer configurations.
SpeedFixer overrides all speedbreaker features of the "NFSMW ExtraOptions" mod by ExOptsTeam.






── ■ │ 2 - HOW DO I INSTALL SPEEDHATER FOR MY GAME? │ ■ ───────────────────────────────────────────

BEFORE INSTALLING SpeedFixer:
 1) • make sure your original copy of the game wasn't a repack or came pre-modified in any way,
 2) • read and understand the two sections about mod (in)compatibilities above,
 3) • make sure your game's "speed.exe" is compatible (i.e. 5.75 MB / 6,029,312 bytes large), and
 4) • install an .asi loader or any mod with one (e.g. the "WideScreenFix" mod by ThirteenAG).

TO INSTALL SpeedFixer:
 1) • if it doesn't exist already, create a "scripts" folder in your game's installation folder;
 2) • copy the contents of SpeedFixer's "scripts" folder to your game's "scripts" folder; and
 3) • if SpeedFixer's .asi file gets flagged by your antivirus software, whitelist the file.

AFTER INSTALLING SpeedFixer, edit the "NFSMWSpeedFixerSettings.ini" file to your liking.

TO UNINSTALL SpeedFixer, remove its files from your game's "scripts" folder.

TO UPDATE SpeedFixer, uninstall it and repeat the installation process above.
If you update from a version older than v1.00.00, replace the old configuration file.






── ■ │ 3 - HOW MAY I SHARE OR BUNDLE SPEEDHATER? │ ■ ──────────────────────────────────────────────

You are free to bundle SpeedFixer and its files with your own mod, NO CREDIT REQUIRED.
In the interest of code transparency, however, consider linking to SpeedFixer's GitHub repository 
(https://github.com/rng-guy/NFSMWSpeedFixer) somewhere in your mod's documentation (e.g. README).
