SpeedFixer lets you customise the speedbreaker mechanic:
 • the car speed required to activate it,
 • up to how long it lasts per activation,
 • whether it can be recharged passively,
 • the car speed required for passive recharging,
 • how long passive recharging takes to complete,
 • how effective active recharging (by drifting) is,
 • the drifting speed required for active recharging,
 • the slip angle required for active recharging,
 • the slowdown factor for in-game time,
 • the car-mass scale for collisions,
 • the gravity scale for downforce,
 • the boost to steering friction,
 • the maximum steering angle,
 • the amount of aerodynamic drag, and
 • the amount of steering drag.

The SECTIONS BELOW address these questions in detail:
 1) • What mods are (in)compatible with SpeedFixer?
 2) • How do I install SpeedFixer for my game?
 3) • How may I share or bundle SpeedFixer?
 4) • What changed in each version of SpeedFixer?






── ■ │ 1 - WHAT MODS ARE (IN)COMPATIBLE WITH SPEEDFIXER? │ ■ ──────────────────────────────────────

All VLTED AND BINARY MODS should be fully compatible with all SpeedFixer configurations.

Almost all OTHER .ASI MODS should be fully compatible with all SpeedFixer configurations.
SpeedFixer overrides all speedbreaker features of the "NFSMW ExtraOptions" mod by ExOptsTeam.






── ■ │ 2 - HOW DO I INSTALL SPEEDFIXER FOR MY GAME? │ ■ ───────────────────────────────────────────

BEFORE INSTALLING SpeedFixer:
 1) • make sure your original copy of the game wasn't a repack or came pre-modified in any way,
 2) • read and understand the two sections about mod (in)compatibilities above,
 3) • make sure your game's "speed.exe" is compatible (i.e. 5.75 MB / 6,029,312 bytes large), and
 4) • install an .asi loader or any mod with one (e.g. the "WideScreenFix" mod by ThirteenAG).

TO INSTALL SpeedFixer:
 1) • if it doesn't exist already, create a "scripts" folder in your game's installation folder;
 2) • copy the contents of SpeedFixer's "scripts" folder to your game's "scripts" folder; and
 3) • if SpeedFixer's .asi file gets flagged by your antivirus software, whitelist the file.

AFTER INSTALLING SpeedFixer, edit its "NFSMWSpeedFixerSettings.ini" file to your liking.

TO UNINSTALL SpeedFixer, remove its files from your game's "scripts" folder.

TO UPDATE SpeedFixer, uninstall it and repeat the installation process above.
If you update from a version older than v1.02.00, replace the old configuration file.






── ■ │ 3 - HOW MAY I SHARE OR BUNDLE SPEEDFIXER? │ ■ ──────────────────────────────────────────────

You are free to bundle SpeedFixer and its files with your own mod, NO CREDIT REQUIRED.
In the interest of code transparency, however, consider linking to SpeedFixer's GitHub repository 
(https://github.com/rng-guy/NFSMWSpeedFixer) somewhere in your mod's documentation (e.g. README).
